# Quick start: Presentation

## Presenting

When viewer devices have connected, select *Player* tab from the bottom bar.

To start the presentation, drag an item from the *Content* tab and drop it to the *Presentation area* at the center of the screen.

The status of each viewer device appears in the *Devices* tab.

If you want to draw the attention of the audience to something, drag an item from the *Tags* tab and drop it to a position where you want it to appear over the content being presented.

To change content, drag another item from the *Content* tab and drop it to the *Presentation area*.

Once your presentation is over, tap the *Home* button in the top left corner to exit presentation. Connections to viewer devices will be disconnected and they will return to the Lobby.

!!! note
    If you haven't purchased a license, watermarks will be shown when you are presenting your own content files. This concerns both the control and the viewer devices. Only the control device requires a license. Watermarks will not appear on viewer devices when they are connected to a control device that has a valid license.
