# Quick start: Presentation

## Files

LiveSYNC does not *stream* the content from the control device to audience devices. Only playback commands are sent and received. Thus, each audience device must have its own copy of the files that are used in a presentation. This ensures scalability and good user experience.

Presentation files typically consist of a set of 360-degree photos (.jpg), 360-degree videos (.mp4), and custom hotspots (.png). Also ordinary 2D photos and videos can be used.
