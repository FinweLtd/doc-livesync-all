## The Device

### What is it?

[**Oculus Go**](https://www.oculus.com/go/) is an affordable standalone VR headset from [Oculus](https://www.oculus.com), a company owned by [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com).

It has many similarities to [**GearVR**](https://www.samsung.com/global/galaxy/gear-vr/), a product made by [Samsung](https://www.samsung.com). In fact, GearVR uses technology and software from Oculus and is marketed under *Powered by Oculus* term.

The main difference is that Oculus Go is a new standalone device, whereas GearVR consists of an older style combination of a VR frame and a compatible Samsung phone.

In both cases applications are installed from [Oculus Store](https://www.oculus.com/experiences/go/) and same app builds can work on both products. Also the user experience, visual quality and interaction mechanism are almost the same.

Both products are 3DOF devices (three degrees of freedom), ie. you can look around in VR by turning your head, but you cannot walk in VR by physically taking steps. There are no need for a computer and no wires. You can simply take the headset out of your bag, put it on your face and start using it. Bundled hand remote is used as a pointer when selecting objects from screen.

### Should I get an Oculus Go or a GearVR?

If you already own a [compatible](https://www.samsung.com/global/galaxy/gear-vr/) Samsung phone, purchasing only the VR frame is an affordable choice (about $110). GearVR headset is a lightweight addition to your bag if you travel a lot and carry a large-screen phone anyway.

However, in most cases Oculus Go is a better choice. Since it is a standalone device it has a battery of its own and you can dedicate the device for its sole purpose: VR. You will also save a fortune if you need a large number of headsets.
