# LiveSYNC on Oculus Go

## Setup

### Oculus app

When you receive your Oculus Go headset, unpack it and start the initial setup procedure. It might be a bit surprising, but you must install *an application to your phone*:

> To set up and connect your Oculus Go, you'll need to download the Oculus app on your supported mobile phone. With the Oculus app, you can set up your headset, browse VR games and apps and customize your device settings. *(Oculus Go website)*

This accompanying app is **mandatory** during the initial setup of the headset. After that you will need it very rarely, if ever. If you plan to purchase multiple headsets, they can be all set up and configured from a single phone. Download the Oculus Go app from here:

<https://oculus.com/app>

Alternatively, you can use these direct links for [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.oculus.twilight) and [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/oculus-vr/id1366478176).

!!! note
    This is NOT the same app that you use with a GearVR headset. Both apps have the same name *Oculus*. You can differentiate them from the icon: GearVR app icon has text GearVR, Oculus Go app icon does not have any text.

### Pairing & setup

Follow these steps to pair your phone with the headset and go through the initial setup.

5. Turn on your Oculus Go device. Press *Continue*.

6. Plug your Oculus Go into a power source. Press *Continue*.

7. After search completes, found headsets are listed. If multiple devices were found nearby, choose the one with matching serial number. The number is below the barcode under the head strap. Press *Continue*.

8. Select a Wifi access point that will be used for connecting the headset to the network. Press *Continue*.

*Once the pairing and setup is complete, your headset(s) will appear in *Settings* tab.*

### First time use

Go to your Oculus Go device. Put the headset on your face. There is *an infrared proximity sensor* inside the headset (between the lenses). The headset will wake up automatically and you will hear a greeting sound.

Grab the hand controller and point straight ahead to the direction you are looking at. Then, *press and hold* the Oculus button (ring symbol) on the hand controller.

*Whenever the device wakes up from sleep you must calibrate the hand remote.*

!!! note
    Every time the headset wakes up from sleep it will present *a calibration dialog*. Calibration is necessary, because the headset and the hand remote are two independent devices. They are both only aware of *rotation around their own center point*. Moreover, the devices do not know what actual direction they are pointing at (for example, North, South-East, etc.). Hence, they need to be calibrated by making them point to the same direction and then pressing a button to signal this. Unfortunately, this needs to be repeated every time the headset wakes up. Sensors are turned off to save power during sleep, hence they will lose the tracking.

After calibration and first time use tutorial you will enter *Oculus Home*. Here you can install new apps, start installed apps, configure the headset, and use services offered by Oculus.

*The Oculus Home.*

!!! tip
    We recommend that you spend some time to play around with the device. Get familiar with the hand remote and Oculus Home. Try a couple of pre-installed apps. Ask your boss a permission to take it home for the weekend and watch a couple of movies from Netflix or Youtube VR.

### Installing LiveSYNC

Once you feel familiar with Oculus Go, it is time to install the LiveSYNC app. The installation can be triggered either via the accompanying Oculus app on your phone (outside VR) or via Oculus Home (inside VR).

!!! info
    LiveSYNC has not officially launched on Oculus platform yet. However, you can start using it already by installing it from our beta channel. Follow the steps below.

1. Check your Oculus username and email. Start the Oculus accompanying app on your phone, navigate to *Settings*, and find the username and email (see the image below):

2. Installing software from Oculus beta channel requires *an invite*. [Contact us](../support/support.md) and tell that you want to join LiveSYNC beta channel for Oculus Go. **We need the email address from Step 1 to be able to add you**. This cannot be just one of your email addresses; it has to be the one that is connected with your Oculus account.

3. Once you receive an invite email from Oculus to that email address, accept the invite by clicking a confirmation link in the email. Notice that we must send each invite manually, so it can take a while before the email arrives.
