# LiveSYNC on Oculus Go

## Presenting

Assuming you have already done [setup](oculus_go_setup.md) and [preparation](oculus_go_preparing.md), you are now ready to start a presentation. You will find out that presenting content via Oculus Go headsets is very similar to presenting with any other LiveSYNC compatible viewing device.

### Connecting

Connect all viewing devices to the control device as follows:

1. On your control device, start the LiveSYNC app. From *Home* screen, select a channel that you want to use. The *Mosaic* view appears. The control device is now waiting for viewing devices to join the channel.

2. On each of your viewing devices, start the LiveSYNC app. From *Home* screen, select the same channel that you selected on the control device. The *Lobby* view appears. The viewing device is now looking for the control device and attempting to join the channel.

3. Live views from the viewing devices begin to appear in the control device's *Mosaic* view. Wait until all connections are established and you can see live view from each viewing device.

### Playing media

Play photo and video content as follows:

1. On your control device, navigate to *Player* tab using the bottom bar.

2. Drag a media item from the *Content* tab to the *Presentation area* and drop it there. The content will be loaded and rendered on screen on the control device. All connected viewing devices will also load the same content and render it on screen.

3. You can pan the view by dragging the view with one finger inside the *Presentation area*. You can also zoom the view using the pinch gesture within the *Presentation area*. **Notice that panning and zooming affects only locally - not to other viewing devices**. The audience will pan (and zoom on supported devices) by themselves. With VR headsets such as Oculus Go, panning is performed simply by turning one's head.

4. In case of video content, a *Control Panel* automatically appears at the bottom of the *Presentation area*. *Play*, *Pause* and *Seekbar* controls work just like in any other video player. You can also enable *Looping* to continuously repeat the video, and observe the remaining time.

5. Change content whenever necessary simply by dragging another media item to the *Presentation area*. Existing photo or video will be immediately replaced with the new one.

### Marking with tags

In some presentations, the presenter may want to draw the attention of his audience to a specific area of the content. Tags can be used for marking points-of-interest in the content. You can use them as follows:

1. The *Tags* tab contain icons that you can drag and drop over a photo or video being presented. Find a tag that you wish to use.

2. Drag a tag from the *Tags* tab to the *Presentation area* and drop it to the position where you want it to appear. It will stick to the content and appear also on connected devices.

### Observing & guiding

When presenting 360-degree content to an audience, they can freely look around. Hence, at any point in time they are watching at different directions and seeing different things. Moreover, VR headsets are personal viewing devices and block the view from others. Thus, interaction and guidance is usually difficult. LiveSYNC solves this by providing a *live view* from each viewing device to the control device. It works as follows:

1. Live view from each connected device appears in the *Mosaic* tab, and also in the *Devices* area of the *Player* tab. Make a quick glance to see if someone in the audience appears to need guidance. Or, if someone has already asked for help, find his headset based on the name given to that headset. The names are marked over the live views.

2. Assist the user and observe from the live view coming from his headset that the problem becomes solved.

3. If necessary, switch to *Mosaic* view and double tap that particular users' live view to make it full screen. In full screen mode it is easier to follow another user's view. Double tap the view again to resize it back to normal size.

### Disconnecting

1. When your presentation is over, return to *Home* screen by tapping the *Home* icon from top left corner. All viewing devices will be disconnected from the control device.

2. Close LiveSYNC app on all devices.

3. Recharge the batteries.
