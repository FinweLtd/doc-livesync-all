# 2. Installing

## System Requirements

Your hardware must meet the minimum technical specifications outlined below to run and use the LiveSYNC app. If you plan to purchase new hardware, consider our recommendations.

### iOS

Feature | Minimum requirement | Recommendation
---------|--------------------|---------------
Form factor | iPhone or iPad[^1] | iPad for the director mode, either for the audience mode
Model | iPhone 6[^2] or iPad Air[^3] | iPad 5th/6th gen. or any iPad Pro
Operating system | iOS 8.0 or later | iOS 11.0 or later
Accessories | - | AV adapter[^4]

!!! tip
    All iPad Pro models are much more expensive than the standard iPad. When using the LiveSYNC app, they are usually not worth the extra cost. Unless, you prefer to have a larger screen.

    You cannot extend the storage size. LiveSYNC does not support memory sticks on iOS, not even those sold as iOS compatible (they only work with the manufacturer's own app). Hence, we recommend that you invest in a model with large storage capacity.

    In most cases Wifi-only model is enough. Mobile LTE network can be useful if you plan to control other devices via GlobalSYNC and do not rely on Wifi availability.

[^1]: iPhone and iPad are supported. iPod Touch and Apple TV are iOS devices but not supported. Apple Watch and Apple MacBook use different operating systems and are not supported.
[^2]: iPhone 6/6+/6s/6s+/7/7+/8/8+/X/XR/XS/XS Max are supported. iPhone 2007/3G/3GS/4/4s/5/5c/5s/SE are not supported. See [iPhone models](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201296) for reference.
[^3]: iPad Air/Air 2/5th gen./6th gen./Pro (all) are supported. iPad 2010/2/3rd gen./4th gen./mini/mini 2/mini 3/mini 4 are not supported. See [iPhone models](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201471) for reference.
[^4]: You can use the AV adapter for sharing your iPad's screen to a big screen via an HDMI cable. See [product info](https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MD826AM/A/lightning-digital-av-adapter) for reference.

### Android

Feature | Minimum requirement | Recommendation
---------|--------------------|---------------
Form factor | Phone or Tablet [^5] | Tablet for the director mode, either for the audience mode
Model | n/a[^6] | Samsung Galaxy Tab S2/S3/S4 are known to work well
Operating system | Android 5.0 (API 21) or later | Android 6.0 (API 23) or later
Accessories | - | Micro SD card, Micro USB memory stick [^7]

[^5]: Android phones and tablets are supported. Android TV, Android Auto and Android Wear devices are not supported. Chromebook uses a different operating system and is not supported.
[^6]: There are thousands of supported models. It is not possible to list them all here.
[^7]: If your device has a micro SD card slot, you can expand storage size (LiveSYNC supports SD card for media files). Micro USB to USB memory stick (with OTG feature) is handy for copying media files from PC/Mac to tablet.

!!! tip
    There is a huge selection of devices to choose from. Many low-end Android devices have poor display resolution, no support for 4K video playback, and no gyro sensor. Check at least these features before purchasing a new Android tablet. We recommend ~10 inch screen size for the director mode.

    You can extend the storage size if your device has an SD card slot. LiveSYNC supports SD card for media files.

    In most cases Wifi-only model is enough. Mobile LTE network can be useful if you plan to control other devices via GlobalSYNC and do not rely on Wifi availability.

!!! warning
    LiveSYNC's director mode is more advanced on iOS than Android. If you plan to purchase a new director's device, we currently recommend iOS over Android. If you prefer to use Android, please check that the Android version of the app contains features that are relevant to you. It will take time before Android version catches iOS version in features.

### Oculus

Feature | Minimum requirement | Recommendation
---------|--------------------|---------------
Form factor | GearVR or Oculus Go[^8] | Oculus Go[^9]
Model | Galaxy S7/S7 Edge[^10] | Galaxy S8 & GearVR SM-324 (or newer), or Oculus Go
Operating system | Android 7.0 (API 24) or later | Android 7.0 (API 24) or later
Accessories | - | Micro SD card, Micro USB memory stick [^11]

[^8]: Oculus Quest will likely be supported later. Oculus Rift and HTC Vive are not supported.
[^9]: GearVR is also OK, but we prefer Oculus Go as it is a standalone low-cost device.
[^10]: GearVR compatible phones older than Galaxy S7 tend to overheat quickly.
[^11]: If your device has a micro SD card slot, you can expand storage size (LiveSYNC supports SD card for media files). Micro USB to USB memory stick (with OTG feature) is handy for copying media files from PC/Mac to tablet.

!!! note
    You can try installing and using the LiveSYNC app also on models that are not officially supported. If the app is not visible in the store with a particular device, then that device is not supported (even unofficially). If you use an unsupported device, performance may suffer and some features may not be available.

### Oculus

!!! info
    LiveSYNC has not officially launched on Oculus platform yet. However, you can start using it already by installing it from our [beta channel](installing.md#oculus_2)

## Install Beta Version

The beta version is the unofficial test version of the LiveSYNC app. It is available via each platform's own beta distribution method. Beta version is recommended for users who are eager to try out new features and provide feedback.

### iOS

Request access to beta version [here](../support/support.md). Mention that you want to be added to LiveSYNC iOS beta channel, and provide your email account.

If you are accepted as a beta tester, you will need to install the beta version via TestFlight app. This is Apple's distribution method for beta versions.

### Android

There is no need to request access to beta version on Android, as it is open for everyone.

On your Android device, go [here](https://play.google.com/apps/testing/fi.finwe.livesync.player.android) to become a beta tester. Then follow the instructions to install the app from Google Play.

### Oculus

Follow these [instructions](../tutorials/oculus_go_setup.md) to install the beta version on your Oculus Go or GearVR headset.

!!! warning
    We test all releases internally before pushing them to beta channels, but be aware that beta versions are more likely to contain bugs. Feature and user interface changes occur frequently based on user feedback - what you see on a beta release may not end up to store release. Releases are published more often via beta channels. Also, documentation for new features may not be available at the time of release.
