## Charging the batteries

The supplied tablet computer and camera contain **built-in non-user replaceable batteries** that allow wireless use of the 360° kit on the field.

Although the batteries may have some charge left, it is recommended to charge them in full before initial use (as always when preparing for field work).
Charge the tablet and the camera using the charger and cables (supplied).

## Assembling the stand

The camera can be mounted and left as a standalone unit or carried along while walking around (selfie stick -style).

Attach the mini tripod to the bottom of the monopod by screwing them together. Then extend the mono- pod up to the desired length.

Always place the assembled stand on a level surface before screwing the camera onto the monopod.

**Be careful not to overtighten the screws or push the stand.**
