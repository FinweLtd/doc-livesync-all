### Is it possible to add own tags?

In LiveSYNC it is possible to add own tags. Make sure the icons are in **.png** format and all your icons are in a folder. Add *"hotspot_"* before folder name e.g. hotspot_Brands then copy the folder to LiveSYNC directory.

 Pull *Tags* section from the director device to refresh its content.

  After refreshing the tags section you will see your tags added to the list by the name you provided after "hotspot_", in this case, icons will be seen in Brands folder with a drop-down arrow icon.

 The enterprise version of LiveSYNC has a fourth tab called [**Editor**](..//user_guide/editor.md).  The Editor tab is designed for clients and industries who require an interactive annotation using hotspots and tags. This enterprise version comes with a feature to save projects, edit or reuse saved projects, add tags with title and remarks, and later export presentations as pdf format.
