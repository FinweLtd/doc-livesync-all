## 360-degree Content

A 360-degree photo is a controllable panoramic image that surrounds the original point from which the shot was taken. The photos are lined up to make for a continuous circle around the point of shooting. 360-degree content gives the viewer the ability to looking around to the left, right, up and down as desired as well as sometimes zooming.  

Turn around and look at a surrounding environment is achieved through a combination of software and a number of panoramic photos. 

#### Monoscopic

Monoscopic (Mono) images show the same image to both eyes.

#### Stereoscopic

Stereoscopic (Stereo) images provide a different image to each eye. VR headsets were designed for stereoscopic imagery, this is the basis of virtual reality and why the goggles have two lenses, this makes the image feels more natural, impactful and memorable.

## File Naming Conventions

In LiveSYNC the player will automatically downscale your own 360 images in the */Movies/LiveSYNC* folder to the maximum texture size allowed by the playback device, and currently you need to copy them to */Movies/LiveSYNC*, not */Pictures/LiveSYNC*.

LiveSYNC supports both Over-Under and Side-by-Side formats. The only thing you need to to is to add the following prefix to the image file:

   - _3DOU.jpg

   - _3SBS.jpg

   - _3DTB.jpg

   - _3DBT.jpg

So for example if your file name is myImage.jpg, you just need to modify the filename to myImage_3DOU.jpg.

!!! Tip
    **Where to add own contents (photo, video, hotspot icons)?** 
    
    - On iOS devices, use iTunes application to copy your media files under LiveSYNC app.
    
    - On Android/GearVR/Oculus Go devices, use file manager to copy your media files under
    /Movies/LiveSYNC folder (this should be generated automatically upon first start)

!!! Note
     Make sure to use **.mp4** format videos, **.jpg** format photos, and **.png** format hotspot images
