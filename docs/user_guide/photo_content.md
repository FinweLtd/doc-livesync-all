In LiveSYNC the player will automatically downscale your own 360 images in the */Movies/LiveSYNC* folder to the maximum texture size allowed by the playback device, and currently you need to copy them to */Movies/LiveSYNC*, not */Pictures/LiveSYNC*.

LiveSYNC supports both Over-Under and Side-by-Side formats. The only thing you need to to is to add the following prefix to the video/image file:

   - _3DOU.mp4 OR _3DOU.jpg

   - _3SBS.mp4 OR _3SBS.jpg

   - _3DTB.mp4 OR _3DTB.jpg

   - _3DBT.mp4 OR _3DBT.jpg

So for example if your file name is myvideo.mp4, you just need to modify the filename to myvideo_3DOU.mp4 or in case of images myimage_3DOU.jpg.

!!! Tip
    **Where to add own contents (photo, video, hotspot icons)?** 
    
    - On iOS devices, use iTunes application to copy your media files under LiveSYNC app.
    
    - On Android/GearVR/Oculus Go devices, use file manager to copy your media files under
    /Movies/LiveSYNC folder (this should be generated automatically upon first start)

!!! Note
     Make sure to use **.mp4** format videos, **.jpg** format photos, and **.png** format hotspot images
