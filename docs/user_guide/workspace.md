The *player tab*. The player tab is where the magic happens. Contents including bundled demo contents are located on the left side of the view. If own contents are copied make sure to pull contents to refresh the contents list.

When playing videos, a Control Panel appears at the bottom of the Presentation area. Play, Pause and Seekbar controls work just like in any other video player.
