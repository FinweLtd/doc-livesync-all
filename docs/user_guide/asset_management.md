#### File naming convention 

LiveSYNC requires filename convention for 3D 360 over-and-under or side-by-side stereo videos. 

* for 2D 360 videos, no changes are required - mono panorama is assumed by default.
* for 3D 360 over-and-under videos, append _3DOU to video filename before .mp4 extension.
* for 3D 360 side-by-side videos, append _3DSBS to video filename before .mp4 extension.
