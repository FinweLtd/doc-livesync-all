1. On your director device (iPad), set up a new presentation channel (director mode) and notice the 4-digit channel number.
2. On your audience devices, set up a new presentation channel (audience mode) and type in the same 4-digit channel number.
3. Remember to copy your media files on all devices, as instructed during the setup procedure. If you skipped it during the setup, please do it now.
