The *Editor* is a tab in the control device, which provides persistency for tags. You can mark points-of-interest with simple passive tags or add interactive (selectable) hotspots. Such configurations can be saved as projects and used in presentations. They can also be opened again for editing, or exported as a report and sent to a colleague.
