#### LiveSYNC presentation solution

LiveSYNC is a technology that allows **controlling** and **observing** 360 VR video playback on a large number of local and remote devices from a single master device. 

LiveSYNC also supports [**mirroring**](../quick_start/presentation_mirroring.md) the view of a local device to a big screen via the master device. LiveSYNC is easy to use, lightweight and works well also in crowded places.
