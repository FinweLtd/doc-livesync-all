# 6. Presenting

## Overview

In this chapter, we discuss presenting content with LiveSYNC. The material follows the sequential phases of giving a presentation. First, we cover the preparations that often take place a few days before a presentation. Then, we discuss what happens just before, during, and after a presentation.

## Preparing For a Presentation

Giving a presentation is usually a well-prepared situation. Many people come together to discuss, to learn, or to make decisions. Their time is valuable. As a presenter, you want to use it wisely. Moreover, preparing well for a presentation is *expected*. 

Here we discuss how to prepare when you use LiveSYNC as the presentation tool. It is not much different from any presentation. Yet, LiveSYNC gives you capabilities that are kind of like *super powers*. Especially when using VR headset, you will gain almost total control of your audience's visual and auditory senses. Don't be a villain - use your powers responsibly!

### Planning

The very first thing in preparing for a presentation should be forming a rough plan. Of course, there are many kinds of presentations. Sometimes you have the luxury of careful planning and sometimes you are invited ad-hoc to join a meeting and give a brief presentation. In any case, your presentation will be much more successful if you build a good routine around it. Here are some questions to consider:

1. **Goal**

    Why are you giving this presentation? What is the goal you want to achieve? How this presentation helps in achieving that goal? What is your core message? What are the key points that your audience should remember or learn?

2. **Audience**

    What kind of audience are you addressing? How many people? Where are they coming from? How uniform is their background? How can you connect with them? What do they know about your topic already? What are the stepping stones you can build your presentation on? What will they laugh at? What makes them act differently after your presentation?

3. **Event**

    What type of event it is? What is the culture? What kind of presentation style is expected?  What kind of room you are in? Where are you standing and where is the audience? How much space they have around them? What equipment is available and what you need to bring yourself?

4. **Outline**

    What are the main points that you want to cover? In which order will you discuss them? How do you start? When it is time to drop your core message? What will you include to the summary? How will you end?

5. **Content**

    How do you turn your outline into a logically progressing story? What kind of content communicates your message in each point - a slide, an image, a video? When will 360-degree material help and when you should stick to 2D content? What benefit will the feeling of *being there* bring? How can you make use of human's spatial memory? How will you use drag'n drop tags to focus attention or annotate things? What about interactivity?

6. **Technology**

    Which devices are needed in your presentation - a control device, a big screen, a set of personal viewing devices? Are the viewing devices personal or shared? How do you organize distributing and collecting them back? Will you use hand remote controllers? Headphones or room audio? What do you do if someone needs assistance? What if one of the devices fails?

7. **Feedback**

    How can you collect feedback? What the audience thought about your presentation? What did they learn? Did you made an impact? Did they decide to change their behavior after the presentation? In what way? Would they recommend what you proposed for their friends?

### Material

Once you have a plan, it is time to prepare the material that you need in your presentation. This can be for example a single 360-degree video, but often it is a mix of different content types. Here's an example:

- Prepare a set of slides using your favorite editor such as PowerPoint or Keynote. Export the slides as .PNG or .JPG images.

- Capture a set of 2D or 360-degree photos and videos. Dig your own archives or license content from online image and video banks. Or, render 360-degree images from CAD or 3D modelling software.

- Consider what kind of tag icons are needed. Search LiveSYNC's bundled and downloadable icons and image banks. Or, create your own icons.

!!! note
    Timing is crucial in presentations. Usually we create too much material - less is more!
     
     Also remember to take into account the time that is required for managing the viewing devices.

### Devices

Once the material is ready, consider what kind of devices are needed for the presentation. Typically the minimum is a tablet for controlling the presentation and a big screen where the content appears. If you use 360-degree content in your presentation, a set of personal viewing devices makes your presentation much more interesting. Some questions to think about:

1. Who owns the devices? Should each member of the audience bring their own phones? Can you buy or borrow a set of devices? What is your hardware budget? Or will you use your own personal devices?

2. Do you have enough devices? Can they view the content individually or must they share the devices and take turns? What if more people show up than you expected?

3. What type of devices are best suited - phones, tablets, or VR headsets? Which platform, brand and model? How familiar are you and your audience with them? 

4. When will the devices become available for you? How much time you need for configuring and copying assets? Can you do this alone or do you need help?

5. How do you organize distributing and collecting the devices? What are the most common issues that your audience will run into? Will you have assistants to help them? How can you ensure that you get everything back? Can you mark the devices?

### Configuring

Configuring the devices is quick but an important step. Here are some things to consider:

- How to identify the devices? Will you give each device a name or will the audience use their own names? How about color coding the devices and using colors as names? Or, numbers?

- Which communication type to use between the control device and the viewing devices? Bluetooth or GlobalSYNC?

!!! note
    You cannot freely choose the channel number. You are given a random free number when you configure the control device. You can request another one, but not input your own number.

### Copying Assets

Copying the assets takes some time and cannot be done before you get access to the devices. Here are some tips:

- Prepare a *master directory* for your content on your computer. This directory should contain only those files that you need to copy to the devices.

- Install the necesssary applications on your computer in advance. Get familiar with transferring files to your target devices.

- Measure the time that it takes to copy *your* assets to the target devices. Then calculate what is the minimum time you need for copying assets for all devices. Consider if you need help.

### Rehearsing

Everyone insides a presentation that goes smoothly as planned. Rehearsing is the key to success. Learn your material and learn to use LiveSYNC well in advance. If you use personal viewing devices, rehearse with friends, family or colleagues as your audience. You will quickly see in which parts they need help, how long they want to explore a 360-degree photo, etc. 

Don't be afraid to revise your presentation at this step. Often you need to make it more compact by leaving out material. Remember, less is more! It is much better if you leave your audience hungry for more than bored.

## Before a Presentation

The time before a presentation is often tense and nervous - even scary. Even experienced performers feel stressed. While this is a fact of life, there is a few things you can do:

- Come early and reserve enough time to set up everything. Both technology and people tend to surprise us in various ways.

- If possible, reserve a few spares of everything. Maybe you forgot to bring something important, or maybe something that was suppose to be there isn't anymore.

- Come up with a plan B. Nothing ever goes exactly as planned. People are used to that, but they expect that you at least have a plan.

### Connecting to Big Screen

Begin setup from your control device. Turn it on and start LiveSYNC app. Turn on the big screen device. Connect your control device to the big screen. Ensure that screen is mirrored. Check that it is mirrored as you prefer it - only the presentation area or the full screen.

### Connecting to Room Audio

If you use room audio, connect your control device's audio output to it. Alternatively, you may connect the big screen's audio system to it. Check the control device's and audio system's volume levels using material that has the loudest passages. You don't want hear the sound crackling.

### Connecting to Viewing Devices

If you use personal viewing devices, turn them on and start LiveSYNC app. Open the connection between the control device and the audience devices. Check that observing the devices works.

!!! note
    Do not leave the devices on in the presentation mode for too long. You don't want them to run out of battery power before your presentation begins.

## During a Presentation

### Changing Content

### Controlling Playback

### Adding Tags

### Guiding Users

### Handling Latecomers

### Handling Connection Issues

## After a Presentation

### Disconnecting

### Cleaning Up



!!! note
    Before you can start presenting content, you must [create a channel configuration](configuration.md) and [copy the assets](asset_management.md).



### Viewing Devices

The first step in presenting is to **connect the devices to the same LiveSYNC channel**. This allows the devices to communicate with each other ie. exchange command and status messages.

Connect all viewing devices to the control device as follows:

1. On your control device, start the LiveSYNC app. From the *Home* screen, select a channel that you want to use. The *Mosaic* view appears. The control device is now waiting for viewing devices to join the channel.

2. On each of your viewing devices, start the LiveSYNC app. From the *Home* screen, select the same channel that you selected on the control device. The *Lobby* view appears. The viewing device is now looking for the control device. It will attempt to join the specified channel.

3. Connections are created one by one. Live views from the viewing devices appear in the control device's *Mosaic* view. Wait until all connections are established and you have a live view from each viewing device.

*Connected devices appear in the *Mosaic* view. It is easy to observe what every member of the audience is looking at*.

!!! note
    The grid is automatically resized so that maximum amount of screen real estate is used.

### Playing media

Once viewing devices are connected, play photo and video content as follows:

1. On your control device, navigate to *Player* tab using the bottom bar.

2. Drag a media item from the *Content* tab to the *Presentation area* and drop it there. The content will be loaded and rendered on the screen. All connected viewing devices will also load the same content and render it on screen. Video playback starts automatically when all connected devices are ready to play.

3. You can pan the view by dragging with one finger inside the *Presentation area*. Zoom the view using the pinch gesture within the *Presentation area*. Notice that panning and zooming effect locally, not to other viewing devices. The audience will pan (and zoom on supported devices) by themselves. With VR headsets such as Oculus Go, panning is performed simply by turning one's head.

4. When playing videos, a *Control Panel* appears at the bottom of the *Presentation area*. *Play*, *Pause* and *Seekbar* controls work just like in any other video player. It is also possible to enable *Looping* to continuously repeat the video. Keep an eye on the remaining playback time so that you know when it is time to change content.

5. Change content whenever necessary. Simply drag another media item to the *Presentation area*. Existing photo or video will be immediately replaced with the new one.

*Drag a content item to the *Presentation area*. Control video playback via the Control Panel, which appears and disappears automatically*.

### Marking with tags

The presenter may want to draw the attention of the audience to a specific area of the content being played. *Tags* can be used for marking such points-of-interest during the presentation. You can use them as follows:

1. Find a tag that you wish to use from the *Tags* tab.

2. Drag a tag from the *Tags* tab to the *Presentation area* and drop it to the position where you want it to appear. The tag will stick to the content. It will appear also on the screens of the connected viewing devices.

*Drag a tag to the *Presentation area* to mark a point-of-interest*.

### Observing & guiding

Interaction and guidance are difficult when watching 360-degree content using separate viewing devices. How can you instruct if you cannot see the other guy's view? LiveSYNC solves the problem by providing *live views* on the control device's screen. It works as follows:

1. Live view from each connected device appears in the *Mosaic* tab, and also in the *Devices* area of the *Player* tab. Make a quick glance to see if someone in the audience appears to need guidance. Or, if someone has already asked for help, find his headset based on the name given to that headset. The names appear over the live views.

2. Assist the user. Observe from the live view coming from his headset that the problem is solved. For example, if someone in the audience cannot find a point-of-interest, the presenter can instruct him to turn to the correct direction.

3. If necessary, switch to *Mosaic* view and double tap a particular users' live view to make it full screen. In full-screen mode it is easier to follow another user's view. Double tap the view again to resize it back to normal size.

*Observing and guiding users is convenient using the *Mosaic* view*.

### Disconnecting

When your presentation is over, stop presenting as follows:

1. Tap the *Home* icon at the top left corner of the screen. A confirmation dialog appears.

2. Select *OK* to quit the presentation. You will return to the *Home* screen. All viewing devices will be disconnected from the control device.

3. Close the LiveSYNC app on all devices and recharge the batteries.

*To end your presentation, tap the home icon and select *OK*.*
