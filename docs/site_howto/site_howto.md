## Navigating

### Site menu

Different areas of the *LiveSYNC Learning Center* are accessible via *the site menu*. The site menu appears in one of two different ways:

#### Tabs & menu

If your browser window is wide, different areas appear as *tabs* in the top bar. Simply click any of the tabs to navigate to another area of the site. When you scroll down, tabs disappear to save space. Scroll back up to reveal them again.

The pages of an active area appear in a menu at the left side of the page. Click a title to navigate to another page.

This option is typical for desktop and laptop computers.

![Cover](img/tabs_and_menu.jpg)

*On wide screens, different site areas appear as tabs in the top bar. Pages that belong to an area are listed on the left.*

#### Collapsed menu

If your browser window is narrow, the menu appears as a collapsed *hamburger menu* in *the top bar*. Click the hamburger icon to temporarily expand the site menu. Different areas of the site appear as submenus, which you can open by clicking them. To navigate to a page, click its title. Once selected, the menu will collapse again.

This option is typical for phones, tablets, and VR headsets.

![Cover](img/collapsed_menu.jpg)

*On narrow screens, the site menu appears collapsed. It can be opened by clicking the hamburger menu icon. Clicking a submenu reveals pages that belong to that area. Clicking a page title opens that page.*

### Table of contents

Each page on this site has an automatically generated *table-of-contents* (TOC). You can navigate *within a page* by clicking the titles in the page's TOC.

The TOC will appear on the right side of the page, but only if the browser window is wide enough. If not, it will be integrated to the site menu.

### Navigation arrows

Some pages have one or two *navigation arrows* that appear at the bottom of the page. Some pages do not have them.

Use the navigation arrows for moving to the next or to the previous page when you have read the current page.

## Reading

### Languages

The documentation is currently available only in English. Translating the documentation to other selected languages will be considered if there is enough customer demand.

You can contact us via our [contact form](../support/support.md).

### Product variants

Different customer segments need different features. For example, most 360-degree video professionals are interested in using LiveSYNC's presentation capabilities. On the other hand, industrial users focus on tagging and reporting. Thus, the LiveSYNC app is offered in multiple variants. The variants have a common core, but available features vary. The purchased license defines what features are available in a particular app installation.

The documentation site is common to all versions. This means that parts of the documentation discuss features that are available only for a subset of customers.  To differentiate such parts, they are clearly marked with *banners*. For example, users who do not have the Enterprise version of the app should skip sections that are marked with this banner:

![Enterprise feature](../img/enterprise_feature.png)

*An example of a product variant specific documentation. The content below this banner, up to the next section/title, is relevant only for users of the Enterprise version of the LiveSYNC app.*

### Product versions

The LiveSYNC solution is continuously under development and updates are released frequently. We recommend that you keep the app up-to-date. There is one exception to this rule. Do you have an important presentation coming up soon and everything is already set up and working smoothly? Then we recommend that you do not update the app before the presentation.

The documentation site contains documentation for the *latest* version of the LiveSYNC app.

### Conventions

The goal when writing the documentation was to make it as readable as possible. Hence, we use many conventions throughout the text.

We also wanted to provide the facility for readers to learn at their own pace. There are plenty of cross-references (links). Use them for learning more about a specific topic.

#### Example title

There are multiple levels of titles. All titles appear in the table of contents. Simply click a title to scroll the page there. The titles are also *permalinks* (permanent links). You can see the link symbol by hovering over the title with mouse cursor. Then, hover over the link symbol. The link appears in the bottom bar of your browser (if supported). You can also copy the link with the right mouse button.

Regular text appears like this. Important terms and text that appears in a user interface are written in *italics*. Product names are often written in **black**. Links appear [like this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperlink). Numbered references appear inside parentheses [(1.1)][ref1].

[ref1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reference (Reference)

Mathematical operations, configuration file contents, and software code appear in code blocks. Notice that you can easily copy its contents to the clipboard. Simply click the copy icon at the right edge of the block.

```
1 + 1 = 2
```

Quotations are indented:

> Life is short.

Data is often presented as a table:

Hours of sleep | Laziness
---------------|---------
5 | Severe
7 | Mild
8 | None

Lists can be ordered (numbered):

1. Skip the manual
2. Try to use the product
3. Read the manual

Lists can also be unordered (bulleted):

* First things first
* Second things second

Footnotes are used for providing additional information. They appear at the end of the page. You can read a footnote by clicking the link that appears as a number: [^1]

Sometimes, a horizontal rule is used for separating things:

***
