## Introduction to LiveSYNC

### What's new

### What is LiveSYNC?

360° photos and videos (also known as immersive, spherical or VR videos) capture the world in every
direction. Traditionally a photographer or a videographer has decided where to point his camera and
how to frame the shot: what is necessary and what can be left out. Not so with 360-degree content! 
During playback it is the viewer who has control of the viewing direction: he can freely turn around
and even look up to the sky or down to his feet. In fact, we are so used to the frame that limits 
the view that it feels like magic when you experience this freedom the very first time.

Making the most out of such content requires new kinds of tools. By minimum, a photo/video player 
application must support special projections that are used for storing wide-angle panoramic 
content, and provide means for the viewer to pan the image during playback. LiveSYNC is such a
tool, but also much more, as you will soon learn.

While traditional photos are great for creating memories and videos are perfect for telling stories,
the main driving force for shooting something in 360° is the feeling of *presence* that you get when
viewing the content. Even more immersive experiences can be achieved when 360° video is combined 
with 360° audio (also known as positional or spatial audio), and viewed through a virtual reality
(VR) headset. You'll feel like *being there*.

This experience is in fact so immersive that it also isolates the viewer from the rest of the world.
It becomes a real problem when you are presenting content to another person and need to communicate
with him during playback, for example, to give instructions, ask for an opinion, or simply to share 
the experience by chatting about it as the story unfolds. Yet, not being able to see what he sees 
forces you to continuously ask the viewer to explain what's on the screen. How awkward!

LiveSYNC removes this barrier by creating a screen mirroring style copy of the view from the VR
headset to another device, typically a tablet computer. This view is updated in near real-time and
can be further shared to a big screen, for example a TV or a projector, so that even a large 
audience - perhaps waiting for their own turn - can share the experience. Nobody likes waiting, 
though. Fortunately, with LiveSYNC you can connect to multiple headsets, play content synchronized
in time, and observe the views of all of the devices simultaneously in a gorgeous video mosaic.
You can also mix in traditional photos and videos, for example your company's slide deck and promo
video. This makes LiveSYNC a versatile all-around presentation tool.

Yet, not all 360° content is made for entertainment. Imagine that you are selling your summer
cottage and made a set of 360° photos and videos so that potential buyers can virtually visit
the place without spending hours in a car. But wouldn't it be convenient if you could also add 
a few notes to the images, to highlight things you want them to notice and remember? This is
a built-in feature in LiveSYNC: when presenting content, simply drag & drop icons from included
clipart sets over the photo or video - or create your own signs and use them instead. Is it
possible to add text too? Of course.

The enterprise version of LiveSYNC goes much further: you can use a built-in editor to create a
project, import media content, add interactive hotspots that can even fetch data from the network
in real-time, import 2D and 3D maps with camera paths, etc. A really useful feature is to be able
to export all the notes you've made as screenshots into a visual PDF report, and send it to your
colleagues right away. Take a 5-minute tour on your construction site with a 360° camera, add new 
work instructions, export to PDF and mail away - all in 15 minutes. That's what we call *instant
digitalization*.

This is LiveSYNC - and we are only getting started. Welcome aboard!
